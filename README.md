# Blackjack-Game
A Project to create a game of Blackjack

Blackjack is a very popular card game where a player tries to get as close to 21 as possible.
This implementation of Blackjack includes the following features:
* Play with as many people as you want
* Add computer players or human players
* Fully manage player names, balances, and bets
* Create custom decks and play the game with them
* Edit betting properties as well as the maximum amount of hits per turn.
* Save, load, transfer, and configure multiple games using JSON.

The game works entirely on a console interface and uses the command prompt to run.

**_This game is only compatible with the Windows operating system._**
